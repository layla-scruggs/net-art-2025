  <p><i>Now what?</i></p>
  <p>Unsure, you submit to whatever this cave has planned for you. <br>
    Directionless, again. <br>
    Still, you walk and walk and walk. <br>
    You know you've exited the cave now. <br>
  </p>
  <p>You are urged forward, backward,<br>
    Left turn, <br>
    Left turn, <br>
    Right turn.
  </p>

  <p>Maybe years pass. <br>
    You aren't sure.
  </p>

  <p>
    Somehow, you knew exactly where you would end up. <br>
    Layers of cloth now obstruct your vision, though you don't remember tying them around your head.<br> <br>
    You are reunited with the mouth of the cave, <br>
    and then the inverted snowman, <br>
    and then the vault door.
  </p>

  <p class="diff"><i>Something's different.</i></p>

  <p>You remove the first cloth, <br>
    then the second, <br>
    then the third.

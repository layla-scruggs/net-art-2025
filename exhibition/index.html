      <h1>Art Encoded</h1>
      <br>
      <p>Since the 1960s, the ASCII standard has provided a way to encode a limited set of printable characters; 
        for as long as humans have been computing, they have also found ways to create art using what minimal characters were available. 
        While art was certainly not the intention behind ASCII, its availability at the time allowed people to see the artistic potential 
        with what limited resources there were in computing. 
      </p>
      <p>In this exhibition, each piece features some form of ASCII art. Whether it is animated and builds upon itself in the source code,
         or whether each character is peeled away to reveal something hidden, ASCII art remains a staple aesthetic in many net art spaces 
         due to its simpliciy, its retro look and nostalgic feel, and has shaped the way people utilize printable characters.

        <p>A web page featuring an ASCII garden that reveals a poem as your cursor hovers over each character. The slower you move, the easier it is to read.

  <p>You keep your eyes shut tight. <br>
    One foot in front of the other, carefully, dragging a hand against the wall as you walk. <br>
    Each turn contributes to the hazy map of the maze you've been constructing in your mind. <br>
  </p>
  <p>At the seventh turn, the ground opens up beneath you. <br>
    You catch yourself, but something sends a stinging pain from the flat of your foot to the pit of your stomach.
  </p>

  <p>Your eyes fling open.</p>

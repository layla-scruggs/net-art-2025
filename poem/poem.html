Smooth and inoffensive <br>
This will be the basis <br>
For your revolution <br>

Every demographic <br>
If they fail to see it <br>
<em>Are they even human? </em><br></p> 

<p>Every demographic 
<ul>
    <li>Men 18 to 30</li>
    <li>College educated</li>
    <li>Women over 40</li>
    <li>Suicidal poets</li>

<em>Every demographic</em> <hr>
Think about it this way:&nbsp;
Guided evolution <br>
This will be a new breed <br>
Cutting edge but classic <br>
Fully complimentary <br>
Bold and self-sufficient <br>
Symbolizing freedom <br>
And, of course, your product <br>
When the logo's finished <br>
Then we will unveil it <br>
Seven billion people <br>
Instantly enlightened <br>
Everyone's rebranded <br>
All the fighting's over <br>
Say goodbye to conflict,&nbsp;
That design's rejected <br>
There's no longer language,&nbsp;
Only recognition <br>
There's no longer country,&nbsp;
Only corporate colors <br> <br>
